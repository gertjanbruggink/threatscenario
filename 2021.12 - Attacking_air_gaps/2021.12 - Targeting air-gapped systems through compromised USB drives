**Priority Intelligence Requirement(s):**
* Identify characteristics of existing, new, and emerging malware campaigns specifically targeting air-gapped infrastructure. 

**Scope**
* This scenario focuses on attacks that target air-gapped infrastructure via the use of weaponised USB drives. 
* Specifically, this scenario covers automated execution; getting malicious code executed just by connecting an infected USB drive into a computer to compromise an air-gapped system.  
* This scenario focuses only on connected frameworks, not on offline frameworks. 
* This scenario concerns attacks targeting Microsoft Windows systems. 
* This scenario does not focus on non-automated execution activities. In these scenarios, the execution of the malicious code depends on tricking an unsuspecting legitimate user into executing the malicious code. 
* The scenario does not focus on non-persistent techniques for compromise of the air-gapped system, e.g., those designed for in-memory reconnaissance. 


## Scenario breakdown

---

**Objective(s):**
The objective of this attack is to gain access to an air-gapped network using weaponised USB drives in order to exfiltrate sensitive data from an organisation. 

This scenario demonstrates the most likely attack sequence an attacker takes when compromising an air-gapped network based on a review and analysis of industry reporting in 2021-22. 


**Summary:**
Data from the 2021 Honeywell Industrial USB Threat Report indicates the volume of threats specifically designed to utilise removable media almost doubled in 2021 compared to 2020. [^2] This scenario details how malware or malware frameworks implement an offline, covert, and bi-directional communication mechanism between an air-gapped system and an attacker.
 
All malware frameworks relevant to this scenario devised unique ways to reach the target air-gapped network and execute malware on a first system. However, they all have one thing in common: they all used weaponised USB drives. The main difference between connected and offline frameworks is how the drive is weaponised. Connected frameworks usually deploy a component on the connected system that will monitor the insertion of new USB drives and automatically place the malicious component needed to compromise the air-gapped system. 

Offline frameworks do not involve internet-connected systems at all. In these cases, the presence of an operator or collaborator on the ground is required to perform the actions usually done by the connected part of the malware. E.g., preparing the initial malicious USB drive responsible for the execution on the air-gapped side, executing the malware on the air-gapped system, extracting the exfiltrated data from the drive, and sending additional commands to the air-gapped side.

**Scenario walkthrough:** 

* **Initial Access (TA0001):** The attacker initially targets victims through one of the following techniques: phishing with malicious attachment (T1566), human asset installation, spearphishing using malicious attachments (T1566.001), or watering hole attacks (T1189). They seek to gain access to an internet-connected system that is co-located alongside the air-gapped network. The attacker then establishes a persistent shell on a system that connects to their command and control (C2) server (T1059.001). 
* **Weaponised USB Drive:** Once compromised, the attacker weaponises USB drives (T1091) against the victim’s system by embedding them with a malicious payload and some mechanism to compromise the next target: the air-gapped system. The attacker compromises the air-gapped system through USB drive injection. Once the USB drive is connected to the air-gapped system by an unsuspecting user, it executes specific commands (TA0002). 
* **Persistence (TA0003):** Once the malware is deployed through its execution vector, the malware’s capabilities determine the often-powerful persistence methods it will use. Based on our research, most of the frameworks just employ persistence based in the Windows registry to be executed at system startup (T1547.001) or loaded when a process is created via hijacking (T1574). The malware self-replicates by infecting new removable drives that are plugged into a compromised system, allowing the malicious payloads to propagate to additional systems and potentially collect data from air-gapped systems.
* **Defence Evasion (TA0005):** The attacker formats their USB specially to reduce the size of the partition on the USB disk, reserving a small amount (several hundred megabytes) of hidden storage at the end of the disk for malicious tasks. This reserved space is used to create a new custom-encrypted partition that won’t be recognised by Windows operating system (OS) and has its own semi-filesystem with two core directories: ‘In’ and ‘Out’. This method also bypasses many data loss prevention (DLP) products. This is because the software that disables the plugging of unknown USB devices based on DeviceID wouldn't prevent an attack or data leakage when a genuinely recognised USB drive is used.
* **Reconnaissance and information stealing:** The payload running on the air-gapped system usually comes with reconnaissance and information stealing capabilities. The attacker usually does not have direct control over which specific air-gapped system will get compromised, as this largely depends on which system an unsuspecting user will connect the malicious USB drive to. To address this, the following reconnaissance activities are performed: 'Host-specific information gathering related to the system itself', 'Active network reconnaissance/probing', 'Espionage activity', 'Propagation to other hosts on the air-gapped side', 'USB drive-based propagation', and 'Network-based propagation' (TA0043). 
* **Copy stolen information to USB:** The attacker transfers the output from the reconnaissance and information stealing capability back onto the USB drive.
* **Collection (TA0009):** The malware is designed to install and persist in new systems, then continue collecting data for exfiltration.  Some USBs contain malware capable of scanning various paths in victim machines, collecting documents with particular extensions, and passing them on to USB drives when they are connected to the system. 
* **Copy command results to USB**: The results and output of the commands are stored on the USB drive plugged into the air-gapped system. 
* **Command and Control (TA0011):** The attacker sends commands to the malware placed on the air-gapped network through a compromised system in the connected side via a covert communication channel often placed on a USB drive. Some of these frameworks contain the capabilities to receive commands via covert communication channels and install or execute new components in the compromised system beyond existing execution vectors in already compromised USB drives (T1573). Some frameworks go one step further and support a two-way communication protocol.  
* **Exfiltration (TA0010):** When the USB drive reaches the compromised connected system, its contents are extracted locally (T1052.001). The data on the compromised system is most likely exfiltrated to the attacker's C2 server via the internet (T1041).  
* **FIN**


**Considerations:**
* In this scenario we did not note specific vulnerabilities being used. Regardless, we did note several instances of LNK-related vulnerabilities being leveraged. Malicious LNK files are usually used as the exploit to trigger a vulnerability in old components of Windows, such as the Windows Shell, that allow the malware to get remote code execution with no user action required other than viewing the LNK file in Windows Explorer.
